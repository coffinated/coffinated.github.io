                    <p>I’m a grad student in Computer Science, in my second-to-last semester. I studied linguistics for undergrad. My student work in research involved some light coding and data analysis, and I loved those aspects of it so much that I eventually landed back in school to study Computer Science. My elective coursework has included Computer Systems, AI and Web Development, the absolute best class at Khoury College.</p>
                    <p>Now I’m looking for a co-op where I can learn as much as possible about working in the world of tech, and hopefully contribute meaningfully to some projects while I’m there!</p>
